# Welcome to ARINA:  The Scientific Computing Facility of the IZO-SGIker (UPV/EHU)


## AIM

The Scientific Computing Service provides high performance computing resources, specialized technical support and consulting to researchers at the UPV/EHU, other public organizations and companies. The service provides its own computing resources with powerful hardware, upgrade policies and distributes the computational resources. The service analyzes new tendencies in HPC (High Performance Computing) for its possible implementation in the UPV / EHU. The IZO-SGI is part of the [General Research Services (SGIker)](http://www.ehu.es/sgiker){target=_blank} of the UPV / EHU, and therefore complies with the protocols established by the SGIker. All results published using the IZO-SGI resources should acknowledgment its usage and send a copy of the publication. This publications will be used to evaluate the users when prioritizing the use of the Service. The phrase we propose for the acknowledgments is:
