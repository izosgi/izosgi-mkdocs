# Publice Price Catalog

The SGIker Services and the Governing Council of the University will annually approve the table of rates to be applied to the services with specifications of the different modalities, according to the nature and institutional relationship of the users.

The rates, at a minimum, must cover the costs of consumables used in the provision and basic maintenance of the equipment and facilities.

You can consult the [Public Price Catalog](https://www.ehu.eus/SGIker/tarifas_generales/tarifas_CAS_ULT.pdf){target=blank} at the last page of this link.

## CPU/GPU Cost per hour

!!! info "GPU/h cost " 
    Rates for GPU in [Public Price Catalog](https://www.ehu.eus/SGIker/tarifas_generales/tarifas_CAS_ULT.pdf){target=blank} are stablished for fraction of GPU. In that case, each GPU was fragmented in 4 parts.




## Disk storage

The ARINA facility is intended for high computational demaining tasks. For this reason, and in order to avoid issues between users, the Scientific Computing service established a cost of data storage depending on the CPU usage. 

The prices are defined for data exceeding a mean value of more than 3GB / month. 
The units are gigabytes (GB) .  

| Label       |     Anual CPU usage  (days)          |   Unit     |     Cost (€ / GB)     |
|-----------------|:---------------:|--------------|-----------|
| INFO02001      | 2500  < cpu       | GB  | 0.11 |
| INFO02002      | 100  < cpu < 2500    | GB  | 0.54 |
| INFO02003      | 1  < cpu < 100       | GB  | 1.08 |
| INFO02004      | 0  < cpu < 1       | GB  | 1.62 |


## Taxes

!!! Warning " Taxes " 
    Prices shown in the above tables are established without taxes (IVA). For **OPIs and external centers** a 21% of taxes must be added.
